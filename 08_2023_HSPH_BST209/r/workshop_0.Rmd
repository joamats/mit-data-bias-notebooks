## What is a Datathon?

A datathon is a collaborative event designed to bring clinicians and data scientists together in the development of data-driven models. This process involves the use of de-identified datasets from different sources, such as electronic health records. The main objective is to analyze these datasets using both data science and medical knowledge.

A datathon combines medical science and data science to solve real-world problems with existing datasets. It encourages participants from diverse professional backgrounds, including clinicians, researchers, and data scientists. Its ultimate goal is to identify potential projects that could lead to significant contributions in their respective fields. This event promotes problem-solving and data analytics skills, making it a vital instrument to learn Medical Data Science.

## What are the learning objectives?

Clinicians do not need to have existing data science knowledge; Data Scientists do not need extensive medical background.

That being said, the overarching objectives of the workshop, designed in the format of a datathon, are to:

* Familiarize clinicians with the applications of data science in the realm of medical research.
* Acquaint data scientists with real-world medical data, mainly sourced from Electronic Health Records (EHR).
* Foster collaboration between clinicians and data scientists to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the research question, the data at hand, the variables involved, and to identify clinically relevant machine learning approaches.
* Equip clinicians with the ability to translate their research questions and hypotheses into data science language, introduce them to tools like Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, and notebooks in Google Colab.
* Enable clinicians to independently formulate viable Machine Learning pipelines for their future questions and problems based on the given resources.
* Emphasize that the goal is to stimulate discussion rather than find right or wrong answers to the questions presented, highlighting the importance of balancing trade-offs in real-world problems and the necessity of involving both parties in the process.
* Promote the notion of medical data science as a team science, emphasizing the importance of effective communication between data scientists and clinicians. This includes fostering the ability for data scientists to communicate their findings to clinicians and similarly, for clinicians to express their needs and questions effectively to data scientists.


## Case Study and Motivation 

Pulse oximeters are medical devices used to assess peripheral arterial¬†oxygen saturation ($SpO_2$) noninvasively. In contrast,¬†the "gold standard" requires arterial blood to be drawn to measure the arterial oxygen saturation ($SaO_{2}$). Pulse oximeters currently on the market measure ¬†in populations with darker skin tones with lower accuracy.

Pulse oximetry inaccuracies can fail to detect episodes of hidden hypoxemia, i.e., low¬†$SaO_{2}$¬†with high $SpO_2$. Hidden hypoxemias can result in less treatment and increased mortality. Yet flawed, pulse oximeters remain ubiquitously used because of their ease of use; debiasing the underlying algorithms could alleviate the downstream repercussions of hidden hypoxemia.

## 1. Literature Review

**Racial Bias in Pulse Oximetry Measurement**



*This study of 48,097 pair of measures from University of Michigan report nearly three times more occult hypoxemia in Black patients compared to White patients. However, not all Black patients with pulse oxymetry of 92-96% had occult hypoxemia, with the correction factor not straightforward.*

**Analysis of Discrepancies Between Pulse Oximetry and Arterial Oxygen Saturation Measurements by Race and Ethnicity and Association With Organ Dysfunction and Mortality**

*In this cross-sectional study of 5 databases with 87 971 patients,
significant disparities in pulse oximetry accuracy across racial and ethnic subgroups (ie, Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White individuals) were found, with higher rates of hidden hypoxemia associated with mortality, future organ dysfunction, and abnormal laboratory test results.*

**Racial Disparity in Oxygen Saturation Measurements by Pulse Oximetry**

*In this article, we review available data regarding the accuracy of pulse oximeters for individuals with dark skin tones, as well as the clinical implications of device inaccuracy at both a patient and public health level. Moreover, we emphasize the urgent need to address the problem of pulse oximeter inaccuracy for individuals with dark skin tones and provide suggestions for the next steps to address the resulting racial health disparity.*

**Dynamic Errors in Pulse Oximetry Preclude Use of Correction Factor**

*In ‚ÄúRacial Disparity in Oxygen Saturation Measurements by Pulse Oximetry: Evidence and Implications‚Äù [Paper 4 of this workshop] the authors raise the possibility of implementing a skin-tone correction factor to compensate for the overestimation of arterial oxygen saturation ($SaO_2$) by pulse oximeters ($SpO_2$) among individuals with darker skin. We wish to highlight more recent data that suggest this strategy would not rectify the error but rather cement the inequity imposed by current technology and worsen disparities by disproportionately harming patients of color.*

(...) *More concerning, three-quarters of patients had bidirectional errors over time, such that pulse oximeters both under- and overestimated oxygen saturation for the same subject at different time points.*

## 2. Specfic Objective of the Datathon

The worldwide utilization of Pulse Oximeters demands urgent action to prevent further downstream harm. While new devices are being designed, a new approach to recalibrate existing devices is necessary, with the goal of mitigating racial-ethnic based underperformance. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been done before.

We aim to fill this gap by creating a correction model for $SpO_2$ using Machine Learning (ML) methods.

**The hypothesis is that recalibration can be achieved by leveraging an ML model that is fed with $SpO_2$ measurements, alongside with patient demographics, physiological data, and specific treatment information.**
