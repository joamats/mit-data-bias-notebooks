        "\n",
        "A datathon is a collaborative event designed to bring clinicians and data scientists together in the development of data-driven models. This process involves the use of de-identified datasets from different sources, such as electronic health records. The main objective is to analyze these datasets using both data science and medical knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "A datathon combines medical science and data science to solve real-world problems with existing datasets. It encourages participants from diverse professional backgrounds, including clinicians, researchers, and data scientists. Its ultimate goal is to identify potential projects that could lead to significant contributions in their respective fields. This event promotes problem-solving and data analytics skills, making it a vital instrument to learn Medical Data Science."

        "* Acquaint data scientists with real-world medical data, mainly sourced from Electronic Health Records (EHR).\n",
        "* Foster collaboration between clinicians and data scientists to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the research question, the data at hand, the variables involved, and to identify clinically relevant machine learning approaches.\n",
        "* Equip clinicians with the ability to translate their research questions and hypotheses into data science language, introduce them to tools like Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, and notebooks in Google Colab.\n",
        "* Enable clinicians to independently formulate viable Machine Learning pipelines for their future questions and problems based on the given resources.\n",
        "* Emphasize that the goal is to stimulate discussion rather than find right or wrong answers to the questions presented, highlighting the importance of balancing trade-offs in real-world problems and the necessity of involving both parties in the process.\n",
        "* Promote the notion of medical data science as a team science, emphasizing the importance of effective communication between data scientists and clinicians. This includes fostering the ability for data scientists to communicate their findings to clinicians and similarly, for clinicians to express their needs and questions effectively to data scientists.\n",
